<h1>
  A look into the end of Turing School's Module 1
</h1>

<body>
  <p>Mod 1 was perhaps one of the most exhilarating experiences I’ve had in a my life. Every day a constant balance between thriving in the fast-paced-learning environment or succumbing to the scope of the learning that needed to be done. I always strive to bring positive energy to everything that I do, in fact it’s one of my strengths from strengths finder. Yet this experience has made me realize what a thin trapeze I toed everyday.
  </p>
<p>Perhaps the most trying of moments was during the our pentathlon. I remember coming into that week with a good chunk of my project finished, a few solid hours of studying and with a great attitude. This all changed during our 3 hour individual assessment.  For the first hour of the assessment I was making good progress, feeling confident in where I would end up. By the second hour I was starting to feel a bit of the panic setting in, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I had a breakdown during that last hour.</p>
	<p>All throughout the first few iterations of the assessment I had been able to make steady progress and successfully create the methods that I needed. The problem came at the end of the iteration 3 where I had to build the “what can I make?” method. For whatever reason I could not build a version of this method that matched the interaction model. I tried looking up information on ruby-docs, stack overflow and general google results to no luck. I even tried drastic measures and completely rewrote that method and any dependant methods three times and still nothing.
  </p>
	<p>In this moment I started feeling everything negative you could feel during Mod 1.  I felt like an imposter who didn’t belong. I felt that I was letting everyone who believes in me down. I even felt that I should just give up now and not have to repeat Mod 1 again. It was an extremely frustrating and emotional moment for that wasn’t fueled by my desire for top grades, nor was it fueled by passing that assessment. Rather, it was the culmination of many poor grades in project and assessment functionality that resulted in the thought that I could not build functional programs.
	</p>
  <p>The very essence of software development is to build something a user can use to enhance an aspect of life. I would not be able to do this basic thing if I couldn’t build functional programs. It was a very defeating realization and one that nearly got me.
  </p>
	<p>I no longer feel this way and the reason why I ever did is because I was expecting myself to perform at the same level as this image of myself. I pictured myself as an expert when I was still at the beginning of being an amateur. I still needed to give myself time to continue to grow and to continue to develop myself. This meant that I will learn how to improve my functionality because I now at least know that this is an area I want to improve in.
  </p>
<p>I would not have been able to arrive at this conclusion alone, as I tried to solve the assessment. Instead I received plenty of emotional support from my classmates and some wise words from my instructor.
</p>
<p>I could have easily written about a myriad of other experiences in Mod1, such as creating Battleship, working with amazing teammates or how I fit into the culture of Turing. However, I chose to write about biggest struggle during Mod1 because of how important it was to learn how supported I am in this experience.

  Favorite Technical Concept
</h2>

<body id= "technical-concept">
  My favorite technical concept so far has been about the relationships between numbers that modulo can express. It was during battleship that I experienced modulo's impications fully. If I want to relate numbers to each other I can easily build a modulo condition to do so. This was especially helpful in trying to relate objects in an array to other specific locations of the array. While I understand that this idea could get pretty unweilding when we're trying to relate larger sets of numbers. However, it's pretty fascinating to see all the ways that numbers can communicate with one another on a smaller scale.
